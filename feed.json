            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many foreign friends ask me if Balinese people drink alcohol or not. It is an interesting question because the image of Balinese are religious people so they thought we don't drink alcohol. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balinese people, like many other cultures around the world, do indeed consume alcohol. While Balinese culture is heavily influenced by Hinduism, which traditionally views alcohol consumption as a form of self-indulgence and therefore something to be avoided, the practice of drinking alcohol is not uncommon among the Balinese population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note that Balinese Hinduism, also known as Balinese Hinduism, has a different tradition from Indian Hinduism, which is more strict in terms of alcohol consumption. Balinese Hinduism is more open and tolerant of alcohol consumption, as long as it is done in moderation and not to the point of causing harm to oneself or others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common types of alcohol consumed in Bali are beer and arak, a distilled spirit made from rice or palm sap. Arak is often consumed in traditional ceremonies and festivals, and is also served in local bars and restaurants. Wine and spirits are also available, but are less commonly consumed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's worth noting that Balinese people usually drink alcohol on specific occasions, such as at a celebration or a special event, and not as a daily routine. They also tend to drink in moderation and not to the point of being drunk. And also, Balinese people who are members of certain religious orders or those who are involved in certain spiritual practices may choose to abstain from alcohol altogether as a personal choice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, it's also important to note that Balinese culture places a strong emphasis on respect for others and for the community, and thus public drunkenness or any behaviour that may cause harm or disturbance to others is not tolerated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conclusion, while Balinese culture is heavily influenced by Hinduism, which traditionally views alcohol consumption as something to be avoided, the practice of drinking alcohol is not uncommon among the Balinese population. It is consumed in moderation, on specific occasions and not as a daily routine, and public drunkenness or any behaviour that may cause harm or disturbance to others is not tolerated.</span></p>",

While I am proud to share the beauty and culture of Bali with visitors from all over the world, I also have concerns about the potential negative impact that tourism can have on our way of life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main issues that I am afraid of is the loss of traditional practices and customs If young Balinese are more focused on catering to tourists, rather than preserving and passing down the traditions of our ancestors. This can lead to a loss of cultural identity and heritage, and can also result in the commodification of our culture for the sake of tourism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another concern is the environmental impact of tourism. Bali is a small island, and the influx of tourists can put a strain on our limited resources. The overdevelopment of tourist infrastructure can also lead to the destruction of natural habitats and ecosystems, which can have a detrimental effect on both the environment and the local communities that depend on it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these concerns, I remain hopeful that tourism can coexist with our culture and way of life. By being mindful of the potential negative impacts and taking steps to mitigate them, we can ensure that tourism is sustainable and responsible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way to do this is by promoting responsible tourism and educating tourists about the customs and traditions of Bali. This can help to ensure that visitors respect and appreciate our culture, rather than treating it as something to be exploited.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another important step is to ensure that the benefits of tourism are shared equitably among all members of the community. This can be achieved by promoting local businesses and supporting community-based tourism initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conclusion, as a Balinese, I am proud to share my culture and way of life with visitors from all over the world. However, I also recognize the potential negative impacts of tourism on our culture and environment. By promoting responsible and sustainable tourism, we can ensure that tourism coexists with our culture and way of life, and that the benefits are shared equitably among all members of the community.</span></p>",

The locals are known for their bargaining skills and it's a way of life in the island. You will see vendors and buyers engaging in friendly negotiations over the price of goods, and it's a common sight in daily life of Bali. Not only does bargaining offer a chance to snag a good deal on products, but it also allows for an interactive way to experience the culture and gain a deeper understanding of the local way of life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can learn about the culture of bargaining in Bali, as well as the local customs and etiquette, and practice your own bargaining skills by communicating with the locals. Overall, bargaining at a market in Bali is a unique and memorable experience that will give you a deeper understanding of the local culture and an opportunity to connect with the locals, and bring a piece of Bali home with you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all Balinese people are skilled in bargaining, so there is no need to worry if you haven't done it before. Instead, embrace it as an interesting experience. You may find that some vendors are willing to negotiate, while others are firm on their prices. You'll have to weigh your options and decide whether the price is fair or not. And remember, the act of bargaining is not only about getting the best deal, but also about building a relationship with the vendor. So, don't be afraid to haggle and have fun with it! If you're not comfortable with it, you can always ask a local to assist you or just buy the product at the price mentioned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is best to have some one to guide and explain this. It could be a local friend or a tour guide who knows the area. </span></p>",
